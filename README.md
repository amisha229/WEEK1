# 👗 AI Closet: Smart Wardrobe Sustainability Advisor 🌱

## 🌍 Overview
Fast fashion is one of the biggest sustainability problems of our generation. Millions of garments are produced and discarded each year, contributing to landfill overflow, water pollution, and carbon emissions.  
**AI Closet** uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze clothing images, identify their fabric/material category, and suggest eco-friendly actions such as reuse, donation, or recycling.  
The project empowers Gen Z consumers to make responsible wardrobe decisions through technology.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Fast fashion trends drive unsustainable consumption. Most people are unaware of the environmental impact of their clothes.  
This project develops a CNN-based image recognition model that classifies clothing types (e.g., cotton, polyester, denim, wool) and provides sustainability suggestions depending on their ecological footprint.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a CNN model to classify apparel images by material or category.  
- Map predicted classes to sustainability scores.  
- Recommend actions like “Reuse,” “Donate,” or “Recycle.”  
- Encourage eco-conscious fashion choices among young consumers.

---

## 🌱 Sustainability Link
- **Environmental:** Reduces textile waste and micro-plastic pollution.  
- **Social:** Encourages mindful consumption.  
- **Technological:** Applies AI for sustainable lifestyle awareness.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV**  
- (Optional) Streamlit / Flask for UI

---

## 🗂 Dataset
- **Fashion-MNIST** – lightweight, ideal for prototype CNN  
  https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist  
- **DeepFashion Dataset** – large-scale labeled clothing dataset  
  http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html

---

## 🧠 Project Workflow
1. Collect and preprocess clothing images.  
2. Train CNN to classify apparel types.  
3. Map each predicted class to sustainability impact.  
4. Output eco-advice (reuse / donate / recycle).
