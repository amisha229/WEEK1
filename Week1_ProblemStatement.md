# Week 1 – Problem Statement

**Project Title:** AI Closet: Smart Wardrobe Sustainability Advisor  
**Theme:** Sustainability through Responsible Fashion Consumption  

## Problem Statement
The rise of fast fashion has led to massive textile waste and pollution.  
This project proposes a CNN-based image recognition system that classifies clothing items by material and suggests eco-friendly actions such as recycling, donation, or upcycling.  
The aim is to promote conscious fashion decisions and reduce the environmental footprint of clothing.

## Improvisations Done
- Chose a modern, Gen Z-relevant sustainability topic (fast fashion).  
- Defined CNN-based classification workflow.  
- Researched DeepFashion and Fashion-MNIST datasets.  
- Planned sustainability mapping between material types and recommended actions.
